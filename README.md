# Self-GenomeNet

While deep learning is frequently applied in bioinformatics, it is mostly limited to problems where huge amounts of labeled data are present to train a classifier in a supervised manner. Here, we introduce Self-GenomeNet â€“ a method that utilizes unlabeled genomic data to address the challenge of limited data availability through self-training, outperforming the standard supervised training, even when using ~10 times less labeled data.

## Pre-trained models for Self-GenomeNet

## Enviromental setup

Please install the anaconda first.
In Ubuntu, by running the code below:
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
You may need to restart your terminal after installing Anaconda.

Then you can create an environment and install the dependencies with the code below.

```
conda create --name selfgenomenet
conda activate selfgenomenet
conda install -c conda-forge r-base=4.0.3
conda install tensorflow==2.2.0
R -e 'install.packages("devtools",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")'
R -e 'devtools::install_github("GenomeNet/deepG")'
```



## Pretraining: Self-supervised model

First, we will learn representations of the Genome Sequences with reverse-complements using contrastive learning.

To pretrain the model on virus data, try the following command:

```
Rscript R/Self-GenomeNet_pretraining/virus/run_train.R
```

For pretraining the model for deepSea data, try this command: 

```
Rscript R/Self-GenomeNet_pretraining/deepsea/run_train.R
```
Please note, that this is only a small part of the data used for presentation purpose. For running the model on full data to achieve the same results described in the paper, please download them from [the official homepage](http://deepsea.princeton.edu/job/analysis/create/) and run ``h5_to_rds.R``


For running the model on Bacteria data, please download some Bacteria data from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) and put them in the folder ``data/bacteria``. Then run:

```
Rscript R/Self-GenomeNet_pretraining/bacteria/run_train.R
```

Run the ablation pretraining using the command:

```
Rscript R/Self-GenomeNet_pretraining_ablation/run_train_forward_singlelenght.R  # for the forward singlelength model
```

## Semi-supervised learning: Supervised part

We now want to use the pretrained self-supervised model in a supervised step for classification of the Genom's species type, so if it is a phage or a non-phage virus here. 

To train the whole network on virus data, try the following command:

```
Rscript R/supervised/virus/supervised.R
```

For our transfer-learning task, classifying phage vs non-phage virus after training on bacteria data, please try this command:
```
Rscript R/supervised/bacteria/supervised.R
```

The deepSea data will classify on deepSea labels. Try using the command:
```
Rscript R/supervised/deepsea/supervised.R
```
